# duplicate_emails

In CoffeeScript or JavaScript, write a working function that removes all duplicates from an unsorted list of email addresses while leaving the remaining list in the original order. It should be able to handle say, 100,000 email addresses containing 50% randomly placed duplicates in well under 1 second on a typical modern laptop. You may assume any input data structure that you like. Do not use built-in library functions that make the problem trivial. Do not google any answers to this, I want to see your own implementation. (If you can’t do this without googling the answer, this probably isn’t the right position for you.) Bonus points if you put a demo live on the web somewhere for us to see. How would your implementation be different if it needed to handle millions of records? Billions?
